# -Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classification-using-CNN-TensorFlow-
This project demonstrates an end-to-end image classification pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images as Cat or Dog.  The model is built from scratch using TensorFlow &amp; Keras, trained on preprocessed image data stored in CSV format, and evaluated on a separate test dataset.
